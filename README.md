OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

For a detailed introduction, full list of features and architecture overview please visit the official project page:
<https://owasp-juice.shop>


### Overview

This project demonstrates security enhancements made to the OWASP Juice Shop application as part of a cybersecurity internship task. The main focus was on input validation, secure password handling, authentication, and HTTP security headers.

### Features Implemented
1. Input validation using validator library

2. Password hashing with bcrypt

3. Replaced raw SQL queries with Sequelize ORM to prevent SQL injection

4. JWT-based token authentication for secure user sessions

5. Added Helmet middleware to set secure HTTP headers

6. Basic Logging with Winston

     Winston library installed and configured in the server file.
     Logs important events both to the console and a file (`security.log`).
     Logged the application startup to verify logging works.
     Helps monitor events, debug issues, and maintain a record of critical operations.


### How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies  
3. Start the app with `npm start`  
4. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Additional Notes
The code includes commit history with meaningful messages for each security improvement.

TypeScript types fixed for smooth compilation.
